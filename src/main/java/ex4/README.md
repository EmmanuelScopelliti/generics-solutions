## Exercise 4: Creating generic utility methods for lists

The Collections framework provides several data structures for us to use in our programs, as well as a wide number of methods to help us manipulate them. However, we always want more!

Your goal in this exercise is to implement the following generic methods in the `ListUtils` class:

- `find`
- `findLast`
- `filter`
- `intersectionOf`
- `unionOf`

For more details on how each method should behave, please read the description of each method in [`ListUtils.java`](ListUtils.java) and the test methods in [`FilterTest`](../../../test/java/ex4/FilterTest.java), [`FindTest`](../../../test/java/ex4/FindTest.java), [`UnionOfTest`](../../../test/java/ex4/UnionOfTest.java), [`IntersectionOfTest`](../../../test/java/ex4/IntersectionOfTest.java).

Your code should pass all tests defined in [`CoordinateTest`](../../../test/java/ex4/CoordinateTest.java).
