# Generics

These exercises will help you practice creating and using generic methods and classes.

Please read the instructions for each exercise carefully.

Your solutions will be automatically evaluated via the unit tests defined in [`src/test/java`](src/test/java).

It is part of the exercises defining the correct signature for the generic methods you implement. Since the unit tests assume that the correct signature was defined, they don't compile with the current state of the code, and thus, have been commented out. As you modify the method signatures, uncomment the respective tests to evaluate your solution.

IMPORTANT: Before submitting your code, double check if all tests have been uncommented.
